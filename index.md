### Note

> This is more or less a '**Proof of Concept**'. Just to show what can be done using HGX besides of simply counting damage and kills.

> - tanks are tanking the 'right' mobs
> - damage done versus certain mobs
> - save and ability checks
> - damage types taken by oppenents
> - special information for threaders, shifters and many more
> - melee special attacks
> - seen AC and effective AB (min, max, median)
> - a complete bestiary faced during a run

### Introduction

You have to enable javascript to get the most out of these run reports.

The files in the HTML/js folder are unmodified ones taken from

- <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
- <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter">tablesorter</a>

The report files themselves are only containing small amounts of embedded javascript code to add some functionality to few tables and to enable navigation.

In case you are scared either

  - have a look at the HTML and javascript files on GitHub (click the blue 'View on Github' on top of the screen) and examine the files in the HTML folder and below  prior to enabling javascript and/or

  - run a 'sandboxed' browser

Loading the HTML files takes some time (typically up to 15-30 seconds, **please be patient**), the files are up to 3MB in size and rendering as well as the javascript formatting of the many tables are somehow time expensive.

Most of the table columns can be sorted by clicking on the header:
