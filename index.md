### Introduction

You have to enable javascript to get the most out of these run reports.

The files in the HTML/js folder are unmodified ones taken from
  - <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
  - <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter">tablesorter</a>

The report files themselves are only containing small amounts of embedded javascript code to add some functionality to few tables and to enable navigation.

In case you are scared either

  - have a look at the HTML and javascript files on GitHub (click the blue 'View on Github' on top of the screen) and examine the files in the HTML folder and below  prior to enabling javascript and/or

  - run a 'sandboxed' browser

Loading the HTML files takes a few seconds (typically up to 15-20 seconds), these are up to 3MB in size and the javascript formatting of the many tables is somehow time expensive.

Most of the table columns can be sorted by clicking on the header:
